# student-performance-vs-global-trends

### Dataset 1: UCI Student Performance (student-mat.csv)

- **Why I chose this dataset**: This dataset provides real-world student performance data from Portuguese secondary schools. It includes various academic and behavioral variables such as study time, absences, final grades, and support programs.
  
- **How I gathered it**: I manually downloaded the dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance) as a `.zip` file. I extracted and used the `student-mat.csv` file for analysis.

- **Variables used**:
  - `G3`: Final grade
  - `studytime`: Weekly study time
  - `internet`: Whether the student has internet access at home
  - `absences`: Number of school absences
